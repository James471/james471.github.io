Presented original work done during the summer of 2022 on quantizing rotating rigid body dynamics. The work involved the numerical and analytical study of the time evolution of Bloch coherent states under a rotating rigid body Hamiltonian with the end goal of demonstrating Dzhanibekov effect in quantum systems.
