I am James, a 5th year student enrolled in the BS-MS dual degree program at the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research(IISER) Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/). I am majoring in Physics and minoring in Astronomy & Astrophysics. Currently, I am pursuing my Master's thesis in Cosmology under the supervision of [Prof. Tarun Souradeep](https://sites.google.com/view/tarun-souradeep/) at the [Raman Research Institute(RRI)](https://www.rri.res.in/) and [Prof. Jasjeet Singh Bagla](https://www.rri.res.in/) at [IISER Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/).

Apart from physics, I also enjoy coding for both academic and non-academic purposes. In my past summers, I have carried out several projects in computational physics and have also been involved in app and game development. I have been the convener of the Turing Club(Coding Club) of my college. I also actively take part in science outreach.

You can find my MS-Thesis [here](../files/Thesis.pdf).
